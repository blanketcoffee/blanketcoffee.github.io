<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I chose the last row for two reasons, a. I could use my phone. b. No one could see me.<br /><br /><div>She was teaching Ecology, a woman in her thirties, wearing Hijab and reading from her self-defined notes. I felt like saying, Hey Miss, if you couldn't learn it after all these years, how can I, in a matter of months? But I didn't. For obvious reasons.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>It was a boring lecture. And I got bored because at this time of the day, one of my best friends was in college, and the other sound asleep. I thought about switching seats, when I saw this beautiful girl, wearing a red top and black jeans, step out of her seat, and then back in. She had the kind of nose which is just adorable, and the kind of smile that could treat my depression, and the kind of laughter that just made you want to laugh with her. She was beautiful.</div><div><br /></div><div>She was not the kind of beautiful that prevail this religion, not the kind of beautiful that makes you fall in love with them, but the kind of beautiful that makes you want her for the rest of your life. Period.</div><div><br /></div><div>And I missed her. Sitting ten seats diagonally away from her, and given the fact that I did not even know her, I still missed her.</div><div><br /></div><div>The seat on her left was empty. If I sat there, our arms would be touching, and her eyes would be in touching distance from mine, and I could watch her white hands for as long as I wanted, and it was like god himself wanted me to sit with her.</div><div><br /></div><div>From sitting in the last possible seat in the class, I was thinking about sitting in the first row beside my crush, the crush I did not even know the name of.</div><div><br /></div><div>I asked her if I could sit, and she said yeah sure, and put her bag close to her feet, and went back to talking to her friend over to the right.</div></div>
